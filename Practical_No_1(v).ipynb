        "*   **Hierarchical Decision Logic:** The system employs a hierarchical set of decision rules, implemented using `if-elif-else` statements, to process user preferences. More specific preferences, such as `prefers_decaf` and `prefers_iced`, are evaluated before general preferences like `prefers_milk` or `prefers_sweet`.\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Recommendation Capabilities:** The system can recommend a variety of coffee drinks, including \"Iced Decaf Vanilla Latte,\" \"Decaf Caramel Macchiato,\" \"Iced Mocha,\" \"Espresso Shot,\" \"Cappuccino,\" \"Latte,\" and \"Espresso Con Panna,\" based on specific combinations of user preferences.\n",
        "*   **Default Recommendation:** A default recommendation of \"Regular Coffee\" is provided if no specific preference rules are met, ensuring an outcome for all input combinations.\n",
        "*   **Verified Functionality:** The expert system's logic was thoroughly tested with seven distinct scenarios, demonstrating its ability to accurately process preferences and provide the intended coffee recommendations.\n",

        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Rule Prioritization:** The expert system effectively demonstrates how rule prioritization (e.g., decaf preference overriding others) can be implemented to achieve more nuanced recommendations.\n",
        "*   **Expand Rule Complexity:** Future enhancements could involve adding more intricate rules, incorporating numerical input (e.g., desired sweetness level), or integrating external data sources for a more sophisticated recommendation engine.\n"
